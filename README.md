Python Foundations

Documenting my journey from basic syntax to Machine Learning, NLP, and beyond.

This repository is a living log of my progress through the Python ecosystem. It tracks my transition from foundational logic to building complex AI models.

Part 1: Setup

    OS: Arch Linux

    Environment: Conda (Virtual Environments)

    Workflow: Hybrid approach using Neovim for core logic and VS Code for deep debugging and visualization.

Part 2: Basics

    Syntax & Semantics: Indentation rules, comments, and the Python execution model.

    Variables: Dynamic memory allocation and naming conventions.

    Data Types: Working with Strings, Integers, Floats, and Booleans.

    Operators: Arithmetic, comparison, and logical operator implementation.

Part 3: Control Flow

    Conditional Statements: Branching logic with if, elif, and else.

    Loops: Iteration patterns using for (range/sequence) and while.

More to come...
