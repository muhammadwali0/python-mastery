# Python Mastery

Documenting my journey from basic syntax to Machine Learning, NLP, and beyond.

This repository is a living log of my progress through the Python ecosystem. It tracks my transition from foundational logic to building complex AI models.

---

## Section 0: Setup
* **OS:** Omarchy (Arch Linux)
* **Environment:** Conda (Virtual Environments)
* **Workflow:** Hybrid approach using Neovim for core logic and VS Code for deep debugging and visualization.

## Section 1: Basics
* **Syntax & Semantics:** Indentation rules, comments, and the Python execution model.
* **Variables:** Dynamic memory allocation and naming conventions.
* **Data Types:** Working with Strings, Integers, Floats, and Booleans.
* **Operators:** Arithmetic, comparison, and logical operator implementation.

## Section 2: Control Flow
* **Conditional Statements:** Branching logic with `if`, `elif`, and `else`.
* **Loops:** Iteration patterns using `for` (range/sequence) and `while`.

## Section 3: Inbuilt Data Structures
* **Lists:** Ordered, mutable sequences for collection management.
* **Tuples:** Immutable sequences for fixed data integrity.
* **Sets:** Unordered collections of unique elements for membership testing.
* **Dictionaries:** Key-value mapping for optimized data retrieval.

## Section 4: Functions
* **Getting Started:** Defining reusable logic with `def`, handling arguments (positional vs. keyword), and managing `return` values.
* **Scope:** Understanding Local vs. Global namespaces (LEGB rule).
* **Lambda Functions:** Writing anonymous, one-liner functions for quick logic.
* **Functional Tools:**
    * **Map:** Transforming iterables by applying a function to every element.
    * **Filter:** Extracting elements from a collection based on a boolean condition.
    * **Reduce:** (via `functools`) Rolling up a sequence into a single cumulative value.

## Section 5: Modules
* **Importing Modules & Packages:** Organizing code using `import`, `from ... import`, and understanding the difference between a module (.py file) and a package (directory with `__init__.py`).
* **Standard Library Overview:** Leveraging Python’s "batteries included" philosophy with core modules like `os`, `sys`, `math`, and `datetime`.

## Section 6: File Handling
* **File Operations:** Mastering the `open()` function and the `with` statement (Context Managers) for reading, writing, and appending data safely.
* **Working with File Paths:** Navigating filesystems using `os.path` and the modern `pathlib` library for cross-platform compatibility.
